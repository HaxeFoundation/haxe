haxe-rust
=========

A Rust target for Haxe, in development

Why Rust?
=========
It's fast, native and has a native BigInteger implementation!

Getting started
===============
To get started, install Neko (any way you want, just ensure it's 2.0 or above), then grab the latest Haxe source and copy these source files inside it, overwriting them when necessary. Then just build and install per the official instructions!
