(* Interface Variables Removal Modf *)
(* ******************************************* *)
(*
	This module filter will take care of sanitizing interfaces for targets that do not support
	variables declaration in interfaces. By now this will mean that if anything is typed as the interface,
	and a variable access is made, a FNotFound will be returned for the field_access, so
	the field will be only accessible by reflection.
	Speed-wise, ideally it would be best to create getProp/setProp functions in this case and change
	the AST to call them when accessing by interface. (TODO)
	But right now it will be accessed by reflection.
