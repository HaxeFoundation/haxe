	When we pass a class as an object, in some languages we will need a special construct to be able to
	access its statics as if they were normal object fields. On C# and Java the way found to do that is
	by handling statics reflection also by a normal instance. This also happens in hxcpp and neko, so I
	guess it's a valid practice.

	So if we want to handle the reflection of the static MyClass, here's roughly how it will be done:

	var x = MyClass;
	gets converted into
	var x = typeof(MyClass);
