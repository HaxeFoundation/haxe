(*
	Some languages/vm's do not support throwing any kind of value. For them, only
	special kinds of objects can be thrown. Because of this, we must wrap some throw
	statements with an expression, and also we must unwrap it on the catch() phase, and
	maybe manually test with Std.is()

	dependencies:
		must run before dynamic field access (?) TODO review
		It's a syntax filter, as it alters types (throw wrapper)
*)
let priority = solve_deps "try_catch" [DBefore DynamicFieldAccess.priority]

(*
	should_wrap : does the type should be wrapped? This of course works on the reverse way, so it tells us if the type should be unwrapped as well
	wrap_throw : the wrapper for throw (throw expr->expr inside throw->returning wrapped expression)
	unwrap_expr : the other way around : given the catch var (maybe will need casting to wrapper_type) , return the unwrap expr
	rethrow_expr : how to rethrow ane exception in the platform
	catchall_type : the class used for catchall (e:Dynamic)
	wrapper_type : the wrapper type, so we can test if exception is of type 'wrapper'
	catch_map : maps the catch expression to include some intialization code (e.g. setting up Stack.exceptionStack)
