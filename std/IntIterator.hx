 /**
	IntIterator is used for implementing interval iterations.

	It is usually not used explicitly, but through its special syntax:
	`min...max`

	While it is possible to assign an instance of IntIterator to a variable or
	field, it is worth noting that IntIterator does not reset after being used
	in a for-loop. Subsequent uses of the same instance will then have no
	effect.

	@see https://haxe.org/manual/lf-iterators.html

class IntIterator {

	var min : Int;
	var max : Int;

	/**
		Iterates from `min` (inclusive) to `max` (exclusive).

		If `max <= min`, the iterator will not act as a countdown.
	**/

		this.min = min;
		this.max = max;

		Returns true if the iterator has other items, false otherwise.
