		 1. Using `args` to pass command arguments. Each argument will be automatically quoted and shell meta-characters will be escaped if needed.
		`cmd` should be an executable name that can be located in the `PATH` environment variable, or a full path to an executable.

		 2. When `args` is not given or is `null`, command arguments can be appended to `cmd`. No automatic quoting/escaping will be performed. `cmd` should be formatted exactly as it would be when typed at the command line.
		It can run executables, as well as shell commands that are not executables (e.g. on Windows: `dir`, `cd`, `echo` etc).

		Use the `sys.io.Process` API for more complex tasks, such as background processes, or providing input to the command.
