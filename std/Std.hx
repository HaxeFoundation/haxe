		This method checks if a downcast is possible. That is, if the runtime
		type of `value` is assignable to the class specified by `c`, `value` is
		returned. Otherwise null is returned.

		This method is not guaranteed to work with interfaces or core types such
		as `String`, `Array` and `Date`.

		unspecified.

		If `s` is an instance of a class and that class or one of its parent classes has
		a `toString` method, that method is called. If no such method is present, the result
		is unspecified.

		If `s` is an enum constructor without argument, the constructor's name is returned. If
		arguments exists, the constructor's name followed by the String representations of
		the arguments is returned.

		If `s` is a structure, the field names along with their values are returned. The field order
		and the operator separating field names and values are unspecified.
