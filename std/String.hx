/**
	The basic String class.
	
	A haxe String is immutable, it is not possible to modify individual
	characters. No method of this class changes the state of `this` String.
	
	Strings can be constructed using the string literal syntax "string value".
	
	String can be concatenated by using the + operator. If an operand is not a
	String, it is passed through Std.string() first.
