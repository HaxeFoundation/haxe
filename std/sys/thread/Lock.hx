/**
	A Lock allows blocking execution until it has been unlocked. It keeps track
	of how often `release` has been called, and blocks exactly as many `wait`
	calls.

	The order of the `release` and `wait` calls is irrelevant. That is, a Lock
	can be released before anyone waits for it. In that case, the `wait` call
	will execute immediately.

	Usage example:

	```
		var lock = new Lock();
		var elements = [1, 2, 3];
		for (element in elements) {
			// Create one thread per element
			new Thread(function() {
				trace(element);
				Sys.sleep(1);
				// Release once per thread = 3 times
				lock.release();
			});
		}
		for (_ in elements) {
			// Wait 3 times
			lock.wait();
		}
		trace("All threads finished");
	```

extern class Lock {
	/**
		Creates a new Lock which is initially locked.

	/**
		Waits for the lock to be released, or `timeout` (in seconds)
		to expire. Returns `true` if the lock is released and `false`
		if a time-out occurs.
	**/
	public function wait(?timeout:Float):Bool;

	/**
		Releases the lock once.

		The thread does not need to own the lock in order to release
		it. Each call to `release` allows exactly one call to `wait`
		to execute.
