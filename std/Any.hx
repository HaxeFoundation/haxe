/**
	`Any` is a type that is compatible with any other in both ways.

	This means that a value of any type can be assigned to `Any`, and
	vice-versa, a value of `Any` type can be assigned to any other type.

	It's a more type-safe alternative to `Dynamic`, because it doesn't
	support field access or operators and it's bound to monomorphs. So,
	to work with the actual value, it needs to be explicitly promoted
	to another type.
