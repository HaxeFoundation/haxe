	A typed interface for bit flags. This is not a real object, only a typed
	interface for an actual Int. Each flag can be tested/set with the
	corresponding enum instance. Up to 32 flags can be stored that way.

	Enum constructor indices are preserved from Haxe syntax, so the first
	declared is index 0, the next index 1 etc. The methods are optimized if the
	enum instance is passed directly, e.g. as has(EnumCtor). Otherwise
	Type.enumIndex() reflection is used.
