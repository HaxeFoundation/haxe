		Follows all typedefs of [t] to reach the actual type.
		
		If [once] is true, this function does not call itself recursively,
		otherwise it does. This can be useful in cases where intermediate
		typedefs might be of interest.
		
		Affected types are monomorphs (TMono) and typedefs (TType(t,pl)).
		
		If [t] is null, an internal exception is thrown.
		
		Usage example:
			var t = Context.typeof(macro null); // TMono(<mono>)
			var ts = Context.typeof(macro "foo"); //TInst(String,[])
			Context.unify(t, ts);
			trace(t); // TMono(<mono>)
