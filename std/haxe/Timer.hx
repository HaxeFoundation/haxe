	The Timer class allows you to create asynchronous timers on platforms that
	support events.

	The intended usage is to create an instance of the Timer class with a given
	interval, set its run() method to a custom function to be invoked and
	eventually call stop() to stop the Timer.

	Note that a running Timer may or may not prevent the program to exit
	automatically when main() returns.

	It is also possible to extend this class and override its run() method in
	the child class.
