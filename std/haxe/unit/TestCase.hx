/**
	This unit test class should be extended to create test cases. Each test 
	method created in this extended class should start with the name "test".

	These test methods should call the assertion methods:

	 * `assertTrue(a)`: Succeeds if `a` is `true`.
	 * `assertFalse(a)`: Succeeds if `a` is `false`.
	 * `assertEquals(expected, actual)`: Succeeds if `expected` and `actual`
	   are equal.

	```haxe
	class MyTestCase extends haxe.unit.TestCase {
		function testBasic() {
			assertEquals("A", "A");
		}
	}
	```

	The TestCase can be tested using `TestRunner`. 

	To run code before or after the test, override the functions `setup` 
	and `tearDown`.
