		- The primary overload takes the WebAssembly binary code, in the form of a typed array or ArrayBuffer,
		  and performs both compilation and instantiation in one step. The returned Promise resolves to both
		  a compiled WebAssembly.Module and its first WebAssembly.Instance.

		- The secondary overload takes an already-compiled WebAssembly.Module and returns a Promise that resolves
		  to an Instance of that Module. This overload is useful if the Module has already been compiled.
