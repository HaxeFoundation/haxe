/**
	The `AnimationTimeline` interface of the Web Animations API represents the timeline of an animation. This interface exists to define timeline features (inherited by `DocumentTimeline` and future timeline types) and is not itself directly used by developers. Anywhere you see `AnimationTimeline`, you should use `DocumentTimeline` or any other timeline type instead.
