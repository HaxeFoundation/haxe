	The `MediaTrackSettings` dictionary is used to return the current values configured for each of a `MediaStreamTrack`'s settings. These values will adhere as closely as possible to any constraints previously described using a `MediaTrackConstraints` object and set using `applyConstraints()`, and will adhere to the default constraints for any properties whose constraints haven't been changed, or whose customized constraints couldn't be matched.
