/** <p>Workers are background tasks that can be easily created and can send messages back to their creators. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the <code>Worker()</code>&nbsp;constructor, specifying a script to be run in the worker thread.</p>
<p>Of note is the fact that workers may in turn spawn new workers as long as those workers are hosted within the same origin as the parent page.&nbsp; In addition, workers may use <a title="En/XMLHttpRequest" class="internal" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/XMLHttpRequest"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> for network I/O, with the exception that the <code>responseXML</code> and <code>channel</code> attributes on <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> always return <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>For a list of global functions available to workers, see <a title="En/DOM/Worker/Functions available to workers" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Worker/Functions_available_to_workers">Functions available to workers</a>.</p>

</div></div>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to use workers in extensions, and would like to have access to <a title="en/js-ctypes" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/js-ctypes">js-ctypes</a>, you should use the <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/ChromeWorker">ChromeWorker</a></code>
