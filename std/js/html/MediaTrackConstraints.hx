/**
	The `MediaTrackConstraints` dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on. A constraints dictionary is passed into `applyConstraints()` to allow a script to establish a set of exact (required) values or ranges and/or preferred values or ranges of values for the track, and the most recently-requested set of custom constraints can be retrieved by calling `getConstraints()`.
