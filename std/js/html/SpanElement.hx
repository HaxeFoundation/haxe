/** This HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the <strong>class</strong> or <strong>id</strong> attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as <strong>lang</strong>. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. &lt;span&gt; is very much like a <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/div">&lt;div&gt;</a></code>
 element, but <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/div">&lt;div&gt;</a></code>
 is a block-level element whereas a &lt;span&gt; is an inline element.<br><br>
Documentation for this class was provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/span">MDN</a>. */
