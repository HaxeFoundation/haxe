/**
	The `BroadcastChannel` interface represents a named channel that any browsing context of a given origin can subscribe to. It allows communication between different documents (in different windows, tabs, frames or iframes) of the same origin. Messages are broadcasted via a `message` event fired at all `BroadcastChannel` objects listening to the channel.
