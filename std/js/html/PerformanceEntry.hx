/**
	The `PerformanceEntry` object encapsulates a single performance metric that is part of the performance timeline. A performance entry can be directly created by making a performance `mark` or `measure` (for example by calling the `mark()` method) at an explicit point in an application. Performance entries are also created in indirect ways such as loading a resource (such as an image).
