/**
	The `VisualViewport` interface of the the Visual Viewport API represents the visual viewport for a given window. For a page containing iframes, each iframe, as well as the containing page, will have a unique window object. Each window on a page will have a unique `VisualViewport` representing the properties associated with that window.
