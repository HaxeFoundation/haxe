/**
	The `ImageBitmap` interface represents a bitmap image which can be drawn to a `canvas` without undue latency. It can be created from a variety of source objects using the `createImageBitmap()` factory method. `ImageBitmap` provides an asynchronous and resource efficient pathway to prepare textures for rendering in WebGL.
