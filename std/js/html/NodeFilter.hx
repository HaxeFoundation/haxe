	A `NodeFilter` interface represents an object used to filter the nodes in a `NodeIterator` or `TreeWalker`. They don't know anything about the DOM or how to traverse nodes; they just know how to evaluate a single node against the provided filter.

		Returns an <code>unsigned short</code> that will be used to tell if a given <code>Node</code> must be accepted or not by the <code>NodeIterator</code> or <code>TreeWalker</code> iteration algorithm. This method is expected to be written by the user of a <code>NodeFilter</code>. Possible return values are:
		 <table class="standard-table">
		  
		   <tr>
		    <td class="header">Constant</td>
		    <td class="header">Description</td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr>
		    <td><code>FILTER_ACCEPT</code></td>
		    <td>Value returned by the <code>NodeFilter.acceptNode()</code> method when a node should be accepted.</td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr>
		    <td><code>FILTER_REJECT</code></td>
		    <td>Value to be returned by the <code>NodeFilter.acceptNode()</code> method when a node should be rejected. For <code>TreeWalker</code>, child nodes are also rejected. For <code>NodeIterator</code>, this flag is synonymous with FILTER_SKIP.</td>
		   </tr>
		   <tr>
		    <td><code>FILTER_SKIP</code></td>
		    <td>Value to be returned by <code>NodeFilter.acceptNode()</code> for nodes to be skipped by the <code>NodeIterator</code> or <code>TreeWalker</code> object. The children of skipped nodes are still considered. This is treated as "skip this node but not its children".</td>
		   </tr>
