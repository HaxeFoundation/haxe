/**
	A `DOMQuad` is a collection of four `DOMPoint`s defining the corners of an arbitrary quadrilateral. Returning `DOMQuad`s lets `getBoxQuads()` return accurate information even when arbitrary 2D or 3D transforms are present. It has a handy `bounds` attribute returning a `DOMRectReadOnly` for those cases where you just want an axis-aligned bounding rectangle.
