<p>A <code>MediaQueryList</code> object maintains a list of <a title="En/CSS/Media queries" rel="internal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Media_queries">media queries</a> on a <code><a rel="custom" href="/api/js/html/Document">document</a></code>
, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media queries on the document change.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to observe a document to detect when its media queries change, instead of polling the values periodically, if you need to programmatically detect changes to the values of media queries on a document.</p><br><br>
Documentation for this class was provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/MediaQueryListListener">MDN</a>. */
