/**
	Note that as of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see bug 1112702.) Previously in a `readwrite` transaction `IDBTransaction.oncomplete` was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk. In Firefox 40+ the `complete` event is fired after the OS has been told to write the data but potentially before that data has actually been flushed to disk. The `complete` event may thus be delivered quicker than before, however, there exists a small chance that the entire transaction will be lost if the OS crashes or there is a loss of system power before the data is flushed to disk. Since such catastrophic events are rare most consumers should not need to concern themselves further.
