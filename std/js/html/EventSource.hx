/** <p>The <code>EventSource</code> interface is used to manage server-sent events. You can set the onmessage attribute to a JavaScript function to receive non-typed messages (that is, messages with no <code>event</code> field). You can also call <code>addEventListener()</code> to listen for events just like any other event source.</p>
