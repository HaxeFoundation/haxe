	The `BiquadFilterNode` interface represents a simple low-order filter, and is created using the `AudioContext.createBiquadFilter()` method. It is an `AudioNode` that can represent different kinds of filters, tone control devices, and graphic equalizers.

		    <td>Standard second-order allpass filter. It lets all frequencies through, but changes the phase-relationship between the various frequencies.</td>
		    <td>The frequency with the maximal group delay, that is, the frequency where the center of the phase transition occurs.</td>
