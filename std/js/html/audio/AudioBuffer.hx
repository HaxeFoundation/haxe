/**
	Objects of these types are designed to hold small audio snippets, typically less than 45 s. For longer sounds, objects implementing the `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` are more suitable. The buffer contains data in the following format:  non-interleaved IEEE754 32-bit linear PCM with a nominal range between `-1` and `+1`, that is, 32bits floating point buffer, with each samples between -1.0 and 1.0. If the `AudioBuffer` has multiple channels, they are stored in separate buffer.
