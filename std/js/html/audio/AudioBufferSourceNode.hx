/**
	The `AudioBufferSourceNode` interface is an `AudioScheduledSourceNode` which represents an audio source consisting of in-memory audio data, stored in an `AudioBuffer`. It's especially useful for playing back audio which has particularly stringent timing accuracy requirements, such as for sounds that must match a specific rhythm and can be kept in memory rather than being played from disk or the network.
