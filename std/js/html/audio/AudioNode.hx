	The `AudioNode` interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module like an audio source (e.g. an HTML `audio` or `video` element, an `OscillatorNode`, etc.), the audio destination, intermediate processing module (e.g. a filter like `BiquadFilterNode` or `ConvolverNode`), or volume control (like `GainNode`).
