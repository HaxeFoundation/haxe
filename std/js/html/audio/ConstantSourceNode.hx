/**
	The `ConstantSourceNode` interface—part of the Web Audio API—represents an audio source (based upon `AudioScheduledSourceNode`) whose output is single unchanging value. This makes it useful for cases in which you need a constant value coming in from an audio source. In addition, it can be used like a constructible `AudioParam` by automating the value of its `offset` or by connecting another node to it; see Controlling multiple parameters with ConstantSourceNode.
