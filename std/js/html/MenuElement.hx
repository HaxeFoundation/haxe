/** <p>The HTML <em>menu</em> element (<code>&lt;menu&gt;</code>) represents an unordered list of menu choices, or commands.</p>
<p>There is no limitation to the depth and nesting of lists defined with the <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/menu">&lt;menu&gt;</a></code>
, <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/ol">&lt;ol&gt;</a></code>
 and <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/ul">&lt;ul&gt;</a></code>
 elements.</p>
<div class="note"><strong>Usage note: </strong> The <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/menu">&lt;menu&gt;</a></code>
 and <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/ul">&lt;ul&gt;</a></code>
 both represent an unordered list of items. They differ in the way that the <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/ul">&lt;ul&gt;</a></code>
 element only contains items to display while the <code><a rel="custom" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/menu">&lt;menu&gt;</a></code>
 element contains interactive items, to act on.</div>
<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This element was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5.</div><br><br>
Documentation for this class was provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/menu">MDN</a>. */
