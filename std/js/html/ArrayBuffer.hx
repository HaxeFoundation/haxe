/** The <code>ArrayBuffer</code> is a data type that is used to represent a generic, fixed-length binary data buffer. You can't directly manipulate the contents of an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>; instead, you create an <a title="en/JavaScript typed arrays/ArrayBufferView" rel="internal" href="/api/js/html/ArrayBufferView"><code>ArrayBufferView</code></a> object which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.<br><br>
Documentation for this class was provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript_typed_arrays/ArrayBuffer">MDN</a>. */
