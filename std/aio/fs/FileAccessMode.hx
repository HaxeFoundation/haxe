		:TODO: The following doc is copied from man chomd. Is it legal to copy?

		Format: `[ugoa...][[-+=][rwxXst...]...]`

		A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the
		file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the
		file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a).
		If none of these are given, the effect is as if (a) were given.

		The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r),
		write (w), execute (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if
		the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X),
		set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).
		Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of
		the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u),
		the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group (g),
		and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding
		categories (o).

		Example: `var mode:FileAccessMode = 'g+r-x';`
