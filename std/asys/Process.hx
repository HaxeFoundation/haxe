class Process {
	/**
		Execute the given `command` with `args` (none by default). `options` can be
		specified to change the way the process is spawned.

		`options.stdio` is an optional array of `ProcessIO` specifications which
		can be used to define the file descriptors for the new process:

		- `Ignore` - skip the current position. No stream or pipe will be open for
			this index.
		- `Inherit` - inherit the corresponding file descriptor from the current
			process. Shares standard input, standard output, and standard error in
			index 0, 1, and 2, respectively. In index 3 or higher, `Inherit` has the
			same effect as `Ignore`.
		- `Pipe(readable, writable, ?pipe)` - create or use a pipe. `readable` and
			`writable` specify whether the pipe will be readable and writable from
			the point of view of the spawned process. If `pipe` is given, it is used
			directly, otherwise a new pipe is created.
		- `Ipc` - create an IPC (inter-process communication) pipe. Only one may be
			specified in `options.stdio`. This special pipe will not have an entry in
			the `stdio` array of the resulting process; instead, messages can be sent
			using the `send` method, and received over `messageSignal`. IPC pipes
			allow sending and receiving structured Haxe data, as well as connected
			sockets and pipes.

		Pipes are made available in the `stdio` array after the process is
		spawned. Standard file descriptors have their own variables:

		- `stdin` - set to point to a pipe in index 0, if it exists and is
			read-only for the spawned process.
		- `stdout` - set to point to a pipe in index 1, if it exists and is
			write-only for the spawned process.
		- `stderr` - set to point to a pipe in index 2, if it exists and is
			write-only for the spawned process.

		If `options.stdio` is not given,
		`[Pipe(true, false), Pipe(false, true), Pipe(false, true)]` is used as a
		default.

		@param options.cwd Path to the working directory. Defaults to the current
			working directory if not given.
		@param options.env Environment variables. Defaults to the environment
			variables of the current process if not given.
		@param options.argv0 First entry in the `argv` array for the spawned
			process. Defaults to `command` if not given.
		@param options.stdio Array of `ProcessIO` specifications, see above.
		@param options.detached When `true`, creates a detached process which can
			continue running after the current process exits. Note that `unref` must
			be called on the spawned process otherwise the event loop of the current
			process is kept allive.
		@param options.uid User identifier.
		@param options.gid Group identifier.
		@param options.windowsVerbatimArguments (Windows only.) Do not perform
			automatic quoting or escaping of arguments.
		@param options.windowsHide (Windows only.) Automatically hide the window of
			the spawned process.
