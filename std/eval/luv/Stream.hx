		Calls the `callback` whenever data is available on the stream.

		The amount of data read is equal to the length of the buffer passed to
		the `callback`. `allocate` is called immediately before each call to the
		main `callback`, to create buffer, into which the data will be read.

		The end of the stream (typically, when the remote peer closes or shuts down
		the connection) is indicated by `UVError.UV_EOF` being passed to the `callback`.
		Note that this behavior is different from `eval.luv.File.read`.

		Zero-length reads are possible, and do not indicate the end of stream. Instead,
		they usually indicate `UVError.UV_EAGAIN` inside libuv; libuv still calls the
		`callback` in order to give the C user a chance to deallocate the data buffer.
		This is not usually an issue in OCaml (which is the backend for eval target of
		Haxe), so a wrapper of this function can usually simply ignore zero-length reads.
		It is then also safe to convert `UVError.UV_EOF` to zero-length reads in a
		higher-level API, for consistency with reading files, and in accordance with OS
		API convention.

		To read only once, call `eval.luv.Stream.readStop` immediately, in the `callback`.
		Otherwise, the main callback will be called repeatedly.

		both an `UVError` result, and for some data to have been successfully written.
