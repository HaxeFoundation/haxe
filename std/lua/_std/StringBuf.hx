/**
	A String buffer is an efficient way to build a big string by appending small
	elements together.

	Its cross-platform implementation uses String concatenation internally, but
	StringBuf may be optimized for different targets.

	Unlike String, an instance of StringBuf is not immutable in the sense that
	it can be passed as argument to functions which modify it by appending more
	values. However, the internal buffer cannot be modified.
