- Make sure the copyright year in args.ml has the correct value
- Update `version` in `haxe.opam`
- Check if the protocolVersion in displayJson.ml has to be updated
- Create a version tag and push it with above changes (CI needs to run on the tag)
- Make an empty GitHub release in https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/releases
- Wait for the CI to build (check https://build.haxe.org/builds/haxe/, look for `haxe_[date]_refs/tags`)
- Get https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxgithub

	- Tell yourself that you're gonna fix `-doc` generation next time
	- Make sure changelog isn't empty in `./haxe-version/CHANGES.md`
